                <h2>Deckbuilding Basics #1 - Deciding your deck archetypes</h2>
                <p>Before we start building a deck we need to decide
                    the overall strategy, or archetype we want to play. While just putting a bunch of good cards in
                    your
                    deck can work sometimes, the strongest decks have a clear strategy they are working towards
                    throughout the whole game.</p>
                <p>In most card games the different archetypes are typically broken down into 3 main categories:
                    <strong>aggro, control,</strong> and <strong>midrange</strong>.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Aggro</h3>
                <p>One of the more straightforward strategies, aggro
                    decks just want to do one thing - gain lore. It doesn't matter how many cards your opponent draws or
                    how much ink they have if you can just win first.</p>
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/009.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_5/062.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_6/092.png">
                <p>Cards like <strong>Lilo - Making a Wish</strong>, <strong>Gathering Knowledge and Wisdom</strong> and
                    <strong>Olivia Flaversham - The Toymaker's Daughter</strong>
                    are great examples of aggro cards.
                    They don't really help at all when it comes to stopping the characters, items and locations your
                    opponent has in play (often referred to as their "board") but they help you gain lore quickly.
                </p>
                <p>Aggro decks win fast or lose fast, and are typically recommended to new players because they require
                    the least
                    knowledge about your opponent's cards. Your best strategies as an aggro player are relatively the
                    same in every matchup - you're just hoping that you're fast enough at questing that they can't stop
                    you. Typically an aggro deck will do little to no challenging and just focus on playing characters
                    and questing every turn.</p>
                <p>Sometimes you will find competitive players look down on aggro decks for being "easy" or "boring",
                    but even if your plan is straightforward there is still decision-making and strategy required to be
                    successful when playing an aggro deck. Aggro decks are important for keeping slow, powerful decks in
                    check,
                    and with a little luck on your side they have the potential to do well in any tournament. Some decks
                    will really struggle finding ways to stop your characters fast enough, and especially if they have a
                    bit of a slower start you can quickly secure your victory.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Control</h3>
                <p>Control decks want to control the board - banishing opposing characters, stealing lore and trying to
                    take over the game. These decks have their top priority as stopping the opponent, and once that is
                    done then they usually will have a few key cards that help them get to 20 lore as their "win
                    conditions" once they have stopped the opponent.</p>
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/128.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/198.png">

                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/163.png">
                <p>Most control decks will run a large number of cards that are able to banish and stop the opponent's
                    characters. <a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/be-prepared"><strong>Be Prepared</strong></a> is
                    the perfect example of a control card, destroying
                    everything on the board to reset things and regain control of what is happening.</p>
                <p>These decks can be harder to build and play, as you will need to know what your opponents are
                    planning so you have the right tools to stop them. If you think your opponents will be playing lots
                    of little characters
                    to quest quickly - better run board wipes like <a
                        href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/be-prepared"><strong> Be Prepared </strong></a> or <a
                        href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/grab-your-sword"><strong>Grab Your
                            Sword</strong></a> to sweep them all away. If you're going up against opponents that are
                    playing just a few very powerful characters capable of questing for a lot of lore by themselves like
                    <a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/tamatoa/happy-as-a-clam"><strong>Tamatoa - So
                            Shiny!</strong></a> you may be better off running targeted removal like <a
                        href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/worlds-greatest-criminal-mind"><strong>World's Greatest
                            Criminal Mind</strong></a> or <a
                        href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/maleficent/monstrous-dragon"><strong>Maleficent - Monstrous
                            Dragon</strong></a> to stop them.
                </p>


                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/159.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_2/031.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_1/113.png">
                <p>Often control decks start the game out slowly, playing cards to get extra ink or draw more cards to
                    find their powerful cards. Once they play their big board wipes like <a
                        href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/be-prepared"><strong>Be Prepared</strong></a> to
                    even the field though they can then take advantage of their extra cards and ink to keep stopping you
                    while carefully gaining their own lore.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Midrange</h3>
                <p>Midrange decks have a strategy in the middle of aggro and control. Typically they will still play
                    characters that they can get out relatively quickly and start questing with, but also have an
                    element of control through powerful songs or characters with good stats for challenging.</p>

                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_4/069.png">
                <img class="LorcanaCard" src="cards/Set_4/036.png">

                    <a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/tinker-bell/giant-fairy"><strong>Tinker Bell - Giant
                            Fairy</strong></a>,
                    <a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/cri-kee/lucky-cricket"><strong>Cri-Kee - Lucky
                            Cricket</strong></a>, and
                    <a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/belle/accomplished-mystic"><strong>Belle - Accomplished
                            Mystic</strong></a> are all good examples of cards you might see in a midrange deck, as they
                    help you fight back against opposing characters while also questing for multiple lore themselves.
                </p>
                <p>Many of Lorcana's top decks will fit into the midrange category, with some leaning more towards the
                    aggro side of things such as <a
                        href="https://inkdecks.com/lorcana-metagame/deck-amber-steel-469471">traditional Steelsong</a>,
                    and others being closer to a control deck such as <a
                        href="https://inkdecks.com/lorcana-metagame/deck-green-steel-468917">Green/Steel Discard</a>.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Matchups</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, these three types of decks make a rock-paper-scissors style format, where aggro
                    usually does well against control as it can go fast enough they can't stop them, but struggles
                    against midrange decks that can quickly kill their stuff and quest themselves. Midrange decks are
                    just slow enough though that often a control deck has time to take over the game.</p>
                <img src="images/matchups.png">
                <p>The other thing that adds complexity to this is many cards support multiple strategies, so your deck
                    has the potential to be the aggro or the control depending on things like who went first and what
                    cards have been played. </p>

                        <h2>Midrange or Aggro?</h2>
                        <p><a href="https://dreamborn.ink/cards/mr-smee/bumbling-mate"><strong>Mr. Smee
                                    - Bumbling Mate</strong></a> has great stats as a 2 cost 3/3 for fighting for
                            early control of the
                            board, but questing for 2 each turn also makes him a great aggro option for gaining
                            lore.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>A big part of becoming a good Lorcana player is learning how to evaluate the board and decide
                        when you need to be the control, and when you should be the aggro. If two aggro decks go against
                        each other and both just ignore the other and quest every turn. Unless they have a bad opening
                        hand, whoever goes first is usually going to win. However, if the person on the draw can banish
                        a
                        few key characters and take over the board that may be just what it takes for them to win
                        instead.</p>
